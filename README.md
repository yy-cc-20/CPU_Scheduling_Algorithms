# 3 CPU Scheduling Algorithm
### First come first server (FCFS)
### Shortest Process Next (SPN)
### Round Robin (RR) with Quantum time = 4

- Show the Gantt Chart
- Calculate the waiting time and the average waiting time for all the algorithms
- Calculate the turnaround time and the average turnaround time for all the algorithms
- Compare the performance of the algorithms
